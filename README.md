# Hi, I'm Stan! üëã

Here is a peek at my project on the application of Machine Learning algorithms to the field
of business and sales.







## Let's dive inüöÄ



# Machine Learning Algorithms for analysis and optimization of expences in Chipotle stores

**Overview**
* Determined  natural groups of Chipotle stores in the US
(*K-Means clustering, Silhouette and Elbow optimization, Gaussian Mixtures*)

* Developed a subroutine for modern, clear and understandable cluster visualization
(*ConvexHull, Spline Interpolation of boundaries*)

* Found stores that are optimal for restructuring and expences management 
(*Ouliers detection algorithm and its optimization studies*)
