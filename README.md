# Smart detection of under and overperformance in business sales using machine learning

Here is a peek at my project on the application of Machine Learning algorithms to the field
of business and sales.

Let's dive inüöÄ

**Overview**
* Determined  natural groups of Chipotle stores in the US
(*K-Means clustering, Silhouette and Elbow optimization*)

* Developed a subroutine for modern, clear and understandable cluster visualization
(*ConvexHull, Spline Interpolation of boundaries*)
"Image here"

* Found stores that are under or overperforming the neighboors 
(*Ouliers detection algorithm and its optimization studies*)
